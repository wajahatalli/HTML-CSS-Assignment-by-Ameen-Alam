        <h3>Cloud Native Computing:</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Cloud Native Computing program</strong> prepares the students to program in open source
        technologies like, <strong><em>Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</em></strong>
         while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software developmenttechniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>
        
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
        <p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AItechnology,
            via teaching programming in open source languages like <em><strong>Python, Numpy, Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</strong></em>
            and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, andending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>
        
        <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source developmenttechnologies like 
            <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,and Kubernetes</em></strong> while making them
            efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoTCloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
        
        <h3>Block Chain</h3>
        <p>The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like<strong><em>Ethereumand Hyperledger (Fabric)</em></strong> ,
            and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript onframeworks like Node.js. The program also 
            introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding
            of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>
